## 🎨 Design Philosophy

**Color Scheme**: Indicolite Blue 💙  
*Because we're fancy and "blue = trust" according to psychology books we definitely read*

**Animation Style**: Smooth as butter, fast as lightning ⚡  
*No time for slow transitions when love is on the line!*

**Button Behavior**: Progressively more chaotic 📈  
*Like a video game difficulty curve, but for emotions*
